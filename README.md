### Sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews: Should we do away with star ratings?

<div style="text-align: justify">Data collection on sentiment is often hindered by the requirement that reviewers submit a discrete rating (stars) along with their textual review of a product or service. Many do not want to submit a rating and therefore avoid leaving a review at all.The goal of this project is to determine whether, and how well, unlabeled approaches to sentiment analysis (i.e.,lexical-based (TextBlob), transfer learning/DL (transformers))  approximate the actual star ratings that reviewers give.
